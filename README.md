# Electric Eye Buy Now Button w/ Storefront - Add Preorder Support

This repo is a fork of [Shopfy's BuyButton.js](https://shopify.github.io/buy-button-js/)
that provides support for displaying "preorder" status for products
that are available to buy, have an inventory policy of continue, and a stock status of 0

This requires read access to `unauthenticated_read_product_inventory` within the Storefront API permissions
